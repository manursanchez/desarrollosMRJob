Also, showing the total video time for a given unit would be nice.<\\/li> <li>Having the introduction video start each time I load the \\\"\\\"course content\\\"\\\" page is very annoying. This should be changed so that the first video brought up is the next one I need to watch (or the previous one I watched, if I didn't finish it) and even then the video shouldn't start automatically.<\\/li> <li>Show the number of students registered for each course.<\\/li> <li>Localized times visible so people in different coutnries know when new lectures will be posted and when assignments\\/tests are due in their time zone.<\\/li> <li>Better instructions on how to access and complete quizzes. Quite possibly a full step-by-step tutorial would make the process easier.<\\/li> <li>An <strong>optional<\\/strong> auto-play feature that will go from one video to another without user interaction.<\\/li> <li>Reference numbers for each video so that they may be easily tagged in questions on the forums.<\\/li> <li>Expected hours of work required for any given unit.<\\/li> <li>Summary video\\/section for each unit.<\\/li> <li>It would be nice to have an email sent out to all students when there is an important update to the site, such as a new homework assignment being posted.<\\/li> <li>When doing quizzes you are immediately given the answers if you get the question wrong even one time. This should be changed with an option to view the answers.<\\/li> <li>A more visible link to the forums is desirable-- perhaps next to the 'Progress' link?<\\/li> <li>The importance of case (upper\\/lower) and white space in Python is not discussed.<\\/li> <li>Progress bars and game-like mechanics (see KhanAcademy) would be cool.<\\/li> <li>'To learn more'-type link at the end of a video for those bold enough to want more.<\\/li> <li>Mobile support, make the site more accessible for mobile devices.<\\/li> <li>A calendar for each course would be really cool. Populate it with the dates of homework assignments, new videos, tests, etc.<\\/li> <li>Because the videos are hosted on YouTube, they are unavailable from more than a few countries. How about a mirror site where the videos can be downloaded?<\\/li> <li>The emails sent regarding updates in questions contain bad links.<\\/li> <li>PDF version of homework assignment similar to that of the course notes.<\\/li> <li>Khan Academy style quizzes\\/homeworks. This stems from the idea that mastery is better determined by continuing to do problems until you get enough right, as opposed to simply getting a homework questions right or wrong.<\\/li> <li>Different video speeds are a great idea. Not everything will be new to all students and some students may need to go slower than others. The ability to play the video at 0.75x, 1.00x, and 1.50x speed would be very useful.<\\/li> <li>A list of software that would be beneficial to students taking the course (such as <a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/python.org\\/getit\\/\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\">where to download Python 2.7<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/wiki.python.org\\/moin\\/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\">which IDE to use<\\/a>) would be tremendously helpful to new students with little programming background.<\\/li> <li>Until the answer videos are actually available, the 'Next' button should take students to the next question.<\\/li> <li>Links to additional exercises would be good for students who want to go above and beyond.<\\/li> <li>A single account for the main website and all forums would be ideal.<\\/li> <li>Fractional answers to quizzes\\/homework should be accepted.<\\/li> <li>In addition to auto-play, an auto buffer next video, if current has finished buffering option, if possible would be nice. With my slow internet, I'd have to open the next video in a new tab for it to start buffering after the current one has finished.<\\/li> <li>Add some (more)text in the instructor comments. The summary of the video from the units lecture notes would be just fine. Would give people with a slow internet with something to do while the video buffers. Though if you take a look at the <a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/worrydream.com\\/Tangle\\/\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\">Tangle javascript library<\\/a>, it would be nice if you could incorporate that into the instructor comments. Would make for nice, interactive notes that would add to the experience of learning.<\\/li> <li>Make it possible after due date to view the answer one submitted to the homework (to see if one forgot to click submit, or to see if maybe some modifications were made after due date which make it impossible to see why the homework was graded incorrect in retrospect)<\\/li> <li>Re-do the video lecture on TraceRoute (4.17) as there were many mistakes (192.168.1.1 being described as local host, not realizing that traceroute shows roundtrip delay, etc.) Re-do the homework question (4.4) that asks about latency to Cambridge from Palo Alto. Routers don't cause as much latency as the question assumes. The question and \\\"\\\"right\\\"\\\" answer are invalid because they are based on the misunderstanding about traceroute and roundtrip time. <\\/li> <\\/ul> <p><strong>Forums<\\/strong><\\/p> <ul> <li>More intuitive formatting.

I currently have -2 votes left for today and can still vote on posts.<\\/li> <li>Make the FAQ button larger and more noticeable. Perhaps stick it on the bar with the links 'Questions', 'Tags', 'Users', etc.<\\/li> <li>Attempting to sort questions by 'hottest' gives a 504 error.<\\/li> <li>Community wiki's aren't editable by another other than the creator, despite karma.

Post an answer below if you have a challenge to submit for this thread and I will keep updating the list.<\\/p> <p><strong>THE LIST<\\/strong><\\/p> <ol> <li> <p>Write a procedure that takes a string of words as an input (\\\"\\\"banana garage door elephant\\\"\\\") and returns the same list of words as a string in alphabetical order (\\\"\\\"banana door elephant garage\\\"\\\"). <\\/p> <\\/li> <li> <p>Using the tools covered in Unit One, write a program extracting the First sentence of a given Wikipedia entry (the source of the webpage is assigned to a string) and print it.

You are not being asked about this.  Still, fyi, in this case you can define the median in different ways: it can be the (n\\/2)-th value, the ((n+1)\\/2)-th value or it can be defined to be their average.  Thus, depending on your definition you can have<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = 2, if you are choosing the (n\\/2)-th value<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = 5 if you are choosing the ((n+1)\\/2)-th value or<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = (2+5)\\/2 = 3.5 if you are choosing their average<\\/p> <p>Strictly speaking, the median would have been the third definition (i.e. the average of the 2 middle values) but in practice, any of the 3 definitions is fine because the merit of the median filter is not to disambiguate the exact value in \\\"\\\"the middle\\\"\\\" but to discard values on the fringes, also known as outliers.  For example, suppose that you want to find a representative value for the anual income of the players of my all-time favorite basketball team: the Chicago Bulls in their golden era (these values are made up.. I probably am insanely off):<\\/p> <p>income(M. Jordan) = 20 million<br><br> income(S. Kerr) = 0.5 million<br><br> income(T. Kukoc) = 0.95 million<br><br> income(L. Longley) = 0.8 million<br><br> income(D. Rodman) = 0.7 million<br><br> income(S. Pippen) = 1 million<br><\\/p> <p>If you choose the aveage as the representative income you will get 23.95\\/6 = 4 million.  However, this value does not represent the income of the players at all.  Instead, it is totally inflated because of the income of a single person: M. Jordan.  In other words, you have an outlier.  A much better representative is found using the median.  In this case you have:<br><br> sorted incomes: 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, 1.0, 20.0<br><\\/p> <p>Now, the median will be<br><br> median = 0.8 if you defined it as the (n\\/2)th value<br><br> median = 0.95 if you defined it as the ((n+1)\\/2)th value, or<br><br> median = (0.8+0.95)\\/2 = 0.875 if you defined it as strictly defined, ie, as their average<\\/p> <p>The point here is that the exact value of the median, regardless of the definition is, in practice, not important.  0.8, 0.9 and 0.875 are all values that are equally good representatives of the income of the players and any of them is a much better representative than 4 million.  The value of the median was to help us get rid of the incomes that were disproportionatelly high or low.  By the same token, the median will help you find that the wealth of a resided of Redmond, WA is more likely to be around $1M given by the median.  The value given by the average of, say, $50 million, would have been disproportionately inflated by the wealth of the top executives of MS, which are not representatives of the community at all.<\\/p>\\\"\",\"answer\",\"15246\",\"15246\",\"04\\/03\\/2012 19:34\",\"7\",\"\",\"100334809\",\"100008281\",\"25\\/03\\/2013 21:39\",\"100055688\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"0\",\"f \"]\n",

Get the one in the middle -&gt-- 1<br><br> median(100, -5, 5) -&gt-- sort them: -5,5,100.  get the one in the middle -&gt-- 5<br><br> median(5,1,800,3,6) -&gt-- sort them: 1,3,5,6,800.  get the one in the middle -&gt-- 5<\\/p> <p>The homework is asking you to do this for a set of 3 numbers.  you have to decide which one is, as Dave said, in \\\"\\\"the middle\\\"\\\".<\\/p> <p><b>Additional long-winded explanation that gives you a sense of what is the purpose of the median function and how to find its value when you have an even number of elements:<\\/b><br><\\/p> <p>Do not worry about the case when the number of values in your set is even.  You are not being asked about this.  Still, fyi, If you have an even number of values in your set which one do you choose?  In this case you can define the median in different ways: it can be the (n\\/2)-th value, the ((n+1)\\/2)-th value or it can be defined to be their average.  Thus, depending on your definition you can have<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = 2, if you are choosing the (n\\/2)-th value<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = 5 if you are choosing the ((n+1)\\/2)-th value or<br><br> median (1,2,5,1000) = (2+5)\\/2 = 3.5 if you are choosing their average<\\/p> <p>Strictly speaking, the correct definition of the median would have been the third one (i.e. the average of the 2 middle values) but in practice, any of the 3 definitions is fine because the merit of the median filter is not to disambiguate the exact value in \\\"\\\"the middle\\\"\\\" but to discard values on the fringes, also known as outliers.  For example, suppose that you want to find a representative value for the anual income of the players of my all-time favorite basketball team: the Chicago Bulls in their golden era (these values are made up.. I probably am insanely off):<\\/p> <p>income(M. Jordan) = 20 million<br><br> income(S. Kerr) = 0.5 million<br><br> income(T. Kukoc) = 0.95 million<br><br> income(L. Longley) = 0.8 million<br><br> income(D. Rodman) = 0.7 million<br><br> income(S. Pippen) = 1 million<br><\\/p> <p>If you choose the aveage as the representative income you will get 23.95\\/6 = 4 million.  However, this value does not represent the income of the players at all.  Instead, it is totally inflated because of the income of a single person: M. Jordan.  In other words, you have an outlier.  A much better representative is found using the median.  In this case you have:<br><br> sorted incomes: 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, 1.0, 20.0<br><\\/p> <p>Now, the median will be<br><br> median = 0.8 if you defined it as the (n\\/2)th value<br><br> median = 0.95 if you defined it as the ((n+1)\\/2)th value, or<br><br> median = (0.8+0.95)\\/2 = 0.875 if you defined it as strictly defined, ie, as their average<\\/p> <p>The point here is that the exact value of the median, regardless of the definition is, in practice, not important.  0.8, 0.95 and 0.875 are all values that are equally good representatives of the income of the players and any of them is a much better representative than 4 million.  The value of the median was to help us get rid of the incomes that were disproportionatelly high or low.  By the same token, the median will help you find that the wealth of a resident of Redmond, WA is more likely to be around $1M given by the median.  The value given by the average of, say, $50 million, would have been disproportionally inflated by the wealth of the top executives of MS, which are not representatives of the community at all.<\\/p>\\\"\",\"question\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"04\\/03\\/2012 20:20\",\"10\",\"\",\"100329232\",\"100008281\",\"23\\/03\\/2013 16:52\",\"100055002\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"739\",\"f \"]\n",

E.g. lets have <code>a = 2<\\/code>, <code>b = 4<\\/code> and <code>test<\\/code> function returning <code>True<\\/code> if called with an even number, <code>False<\\/code> otherwise. Original procedure will then return <code>b<\\/code>, since <code>a<\\/code> is an even number, but procedure #2 will return <code>a<\\/code>, since <code>b<\\/code> is an even number, as well.<\\/p> <\\/blockquote> <p><em>Procedure #3:<\\/em><\\/p> <pre><code>def proc3(a,b):   result = a   if test(a):     result = b   return result <\\/code><\\/pre> <blockquote> <p>This is equivalent. in case <code>test(a)<\\/code> returns <code>True<\\/code>, vriable <code>result<\\/code> is assigned value <code>b<\\/code> inside the <code>if<\\/code>-block, which than gets returned.

It seems to me that p would no longer be assigned to anything, having been replaced by the variable s (which isn't really the case). <\\/p> <p>Why doesn't s replace p as the variable representing ['a',3,'no']?

A statement such as \\\"\\\"['a',3,'no'] = s\\\"\\\" or \\\"\\\"n + 1 = n\\\"\\\" is an error, since the left-hand entity is a constant or an expression, neither of which can accept a new value.<\\/p> <p>The = operator does have two different uses, though.

E. g.<\\/p> <pre><code># Define a procedure, udacify, that takes as  # input a string, and returns a string that  # is an uppercase 'U' followed by the input string. # for example, when we enter  # print udacify('dacians')  # the output should be the string 'Udacians'  # Make sure your procedure has a return statement.  def udacify(s):     return 'U' + s  # print udacify('dacians') <\\/code><\\/pre> <p><br><br> <br><br> Then I came along the <em>assert<\\/em> statement here in the forums and tried to use them in the end of homework 2 and for homework unit 3 to test my submission. So I again copied the given test cases from the comments and turned them into an <em>assert<\\/em> statement. But since I'm quite new, I'm not quite sure if this is a good way to do it and if I can leave the <em>assert<\\/em> statements in my code or if I need to remove them?<\\/p> <pre><code>def test(n):     if n%2 == 0:         return 'even'     return 'odd'  assert test(22) == 'even', '22 not even' assert test(103) == 'odd', '103 not odd' assert test(0) == 'even', 'what to do with the nought?' <\\/code><\\/pre> <p><br><br> <br><br> What else good and easy (for python beginners) methods are there to test the code instead of using a lot of prints statements which have to be removed before submission?

      "2013\t[\"33943\",\"\",\"cs101 \",\"100003721\",\"\\\"<p>1) assert is usually used to define some precondition, e.g. that your input must be a valid value like a square field for the sudoku homework. You can assert that a square matrix is given. If it's not your code will cause an error. If it causes an error you can usually do a so-called exception handling. But that's not really for testing purposes, that's for spotting that a precondition didn't happen so your program would otherwise be in an uncontrolled state. IMHO don't use it for testing purposes on its own. Just together with tests.<\\/p> <p>2) One easy way is to write some tests like:<\\/p> <pre><code>print \\\"\\\"*** TESTS for test method, that should... ***\\\"\\\" print test(22) == 'even' print test(23) == 'odd' print test(0)  == 'even' <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>Then look at your tests and verify that all your tests return True. You can put those tests at the very end of your file and delete it when you don't need them.<\\/p> <p>3) The other (there are many more) possibility are doctests:<\\/p> <p>First you need to specify that they should be executed. Just put this code snippet (you really don't need to understand that code yet) at the very end of your file (works also for the web interpreter):<\\/p> <pre><code>if __name__ == \\\"\\\"__main__\\\"\\\": # local     import doctest     doctest.testmod(report=True,verbose=True,exclude_empty=True) elif __name__ == \\\"\\\"main\\\"\\\":   # web interpreter (Udacity)     import doctest, main     doctest.testmod(main,report=True,verbose=True,exclude_empty=True) <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>Second, you need some tests. Usually you would put them in the function you test, but you can also put them outside (if you test only one procedure), e.g.:<\\/p> <pre><code>''' (1) 22 should return even, since 22 is divisible by 2. &gt--&gt--&gt-- test(22) 'even' (2) 23 should return odd, since 23 is not divisible by 2. &gt--&gt--&gt-- test(23) 'odd' (3) 0 should return even (http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Parity_of_zero). &gt--&gt--&gt-- test(0) 'even' ''' def test(n):     if n%2 == 0:         return 'even'     return 'odd' <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>As you can see, the doctests start with a triple quote ''' or \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" end must end the same. Then you might want to specify a number for your test case (if you got many tests cases its better to enumerate them). Then followed by some description so that you remember what you wanted to test. After that you see the actual execution of the procedure. After that you specify what the output should be (when the test is correct). Look how doctest differentiates between ('even' and \\\"\\\"even\\\"\\\"):<\\/p> <pre><code>&gt--&gt--&gt-- test(22) 'even' <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>If you wanted to check that it is only printed out, you'd need to specify:<\\/p> <pre><code>def test(n):     print 'even'  &gt--&gt--&gt-- test(22) even <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>Look how this differs! Also it is usually good to check for the output in the python interactive shell how the output should really be, e.g. if you want to test that your output of a list is <code>[1,2,3]<\\/code> you need to write <code>[1, 2, 3]<\\/code>. Look how it differs! (Whitspace between the numbers). Just print <code>[1,2,3]<\\/code> in the python interactive shell to see the needed output.<\\/p> <p>Summery. If doctest is too complicated, you might want to stick with 2) which is also really helpful. assert statements are used together with tests to define preconditions, but shouldn't be used on it's own, because they raise errors.<\\/p> <p>Edit:<\\/p> <p>p.s.: Always separate any tests from production code, i.e. remove any test code in homework submissions. You really should install and use a local interpreter to test and play with your code and the python interactive shell.<\\/p> <p>[Also, I wrote python interpreter, i meant the python interactive shell]<\\/p>\\\"\",\"answer\",\"33878\",\"33878\",\"13\\/03\\/2012 11:02\",\"9\",\"(accepted)\",\"153963\",\"100007264\",\"13\\/04\\/2013 11:25\",\"64076\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"0\",\"t \"]\n",

No, these courses could EASILY hold their own against the best that MIT, Stanford, or Oxford could throw at a student. What we are learning in Sebastian Thrun's class is cutting-edge robotic engineering. What we are learning here in Dave Evans class is REAL computer science taught as it would be at a real, SERIOUS university.<\\/p> <p>Those of us who really want to LEARN computer science, who wish to work in the field, who wish to use the fact that we attended Udacity as a selling point of our own skills, we are GLAD that this class is hard!<\\/p> <p>THINK about it for a moment...years down the road, when a couple of candidates show up for a job and one with a Udacity crediential and the other with a University of Phoenix credential, who do YOU think is going to get the more serious look over?<\\/p> <p>Yeah, that's right! Complain today about how hard it is, but thank your lucky stars tomorrow when YOU nail that great job and the guy who was given the \\\"\\\"print hello 10 times\\\"\\\" question gets the boot out the door.<\\/p> <p>This class is hard for a reason. LIFE is hard! Programming in the real world is HARD. So what, you bombed a question or two? If you are a hard worker and diligent, with a bit of aptitude for this stuff and willing to dust yourself off and get back into the frey, you'll be JUST FINE! I myself almost did not solve problem 3.7. It was HARD for me. I worked on it literally for days (on and off.) Finally...I solved it. If I hadn't, I would've missed one question. I wouldn't have been happy, but I'd still be pulling an A in the class. I sure as heck wouldn't quit! The ONLY difference between winners and losers is that a winner dusted himself off one more time than a loser did. That's the ONLY difference.

      "2013\t[\"37251\",\"\",\"cs101 \",\"100003550\",\"\\\"<p>It sounds like there is still some confusion (e.g. from <a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/forums.udacity.com\\/users\\/100000983\\/monty\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/forums.udacity.com\\/users\\/100000983\\/monty\\\"\\\">@Monty<\\/a><\\/a>, above), so here's a bit longer of an explanation.<\\/p> <p>Variables inside a proc are <strong>local<\\/strong> variables. They only exist inside the proc and cease to exist when the proc ends. This means that the variable <em>p<\\/em> inside the proc <strong>is not the same variable<\\/strong> as the variable <em>p<\\/em> outside the proc. They just both have the same name.  Perhaps if the code was rewritten to be:<\\/p> <pre><code>p = [1,2,3] def proc2(x):     x = x + [1] <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>it would be a bit clearer. In that code, which is identical to the original code, we can see that we are passing a value (which is a list), into parameter <em>x<\\/em>, we are then replacing the contents of <em>x<\\/em> (with <em>x + [1]<\\/em>), which should have no impact on the outside variable <em>p<\\/em>. That is why the original list in <em>p<\\/em> remains unchanged.<\\/p> <p>So, if that makes sense, you may be asking then, why would code like this:<\\/p> <pre><code>p = [1,2,3] def proc2(x):     x.append(1) <\\/code><\\/pre> <p>change the value of p?  The reason is that the code that uses <em>append<\\/em> <strong>changes the actual list<\\/strong>. The list, which is referred to by <em>p<\\/em>, is passed into the proc as <em>x<\\/em>. The proc then <strong>changes<\\/strong> that list, by appending an element to it. Therefore, the list that <em>p<\\/em> refers to <em>has changed<\\/em>.  In the first example, the list that <em>p<\\/em> refers to <strong>has not changed<\\/strong> - all we have done is changed the contents of local variable <em>x<\\/em>.<\\/p> <p>So, if this is easier to understand with an outside variable <em>p<\\/em> and a proc parameter called <em>x<\\/em>, why wasn't the question written that way? Likely the question was worded this way to make it more tricky and to force us to have to think about the difference between <em>assignment<\\/em> (which is happening in the first example), and <em>mutation<\\/em>, which is happening in the second example. Also, as mentioned in the lectures, there is a convention for using <em>p<\\/em> for naming variables that contain lists.<\\/p> <p>I hope this makes the concept easier to understand.<\\/p>\\\"\",\"answer\",\"35984\",\"35984\",\"14\\/03\\/2012 16:40\",\"15\",\"(accepted)\",\"\\\\N\",\"100241743\",\"12\\/02\\/2013 6:29\",\"48650\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"0\",\"t \"]\n",

Some of it is older than it is usable :-D I'll add my 5 cents.<\\/p> <p><strong>All computer languages are equal, since they are all Turing-complete<\\/strong><\\/p> <p>True, but irrelevant. The ultimate version of this is: In the end, all code you're writing will be run by the processor in your computer. It talks in a machine language that consists mainly of moving numbers about, basic arithmetic, testing for a few numeric conditions and jumping about. Thus, every program can be written in machine language. We don't do that, though, because expressing the kind of programming ideas we want is <em>damn hard<\\/em> in the frugal environment of pure machine code. What matters is the expressivity of the language, not its turing-completeness. What kind of code is <em>easy to write<\\/em> in the language?  <\\/p> <p>The canonical reference here is Paul Grahams <a href=\\\"\\\"http:\\/\\/www.paulgraham.com\\/avg.html\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"Beating the averages\\\"\\\">Beating the averages<\\/a>, where he is talking about building production code in another \\\"\\\"Too theoretical, too slow, too highlevel\\\"\\\" language - Common Lisp.<\\/p> <p><strong>Python is too slow, because it is interpreted<\\/strong><\\/p> <p>This is also half-true at best. The standard way of developing in Python is to do it in the interactive, interpreted environment. This is for good reasons - This kind of incremental development environment is very effective in the speed of the write-test-debug-cycle and the in-place testing. However, there is nothing that stops you from compiling the finished code with something like Cython when it is time for release, adding things like type hints and so on to increase effectiveness. There are tools like PyChecker that you would use to go through the code and warn for potential problems. It is just that these are not forced upon you from the start.<\\/p> <p>Java, by the way, is an interpreted language in exactly the same way as Python is. I do believe that it is used in one or another big system.<\\/p> <p><strong>Python can do everything that any other language can do<\\/strong><\\/p> <p>Not true, either. In Python, we have a lot of very powerful constructs on the high-level-end: mapping over sequences, list comprehensions, a dynamic object model. On the other hand, we are lacking stuff at the low-level end - If we want to bang hard on memory adresses or control the storage models for our complex numbers, we cant. Python is a fairly unashamed highlevel language. If you want to do lowlevel stuff stuff, use a lowlevel language like C. <\\/p> <p>(This taps into another misunderstanding: <em>A highlevel language is better than a lowlevel language, because it is highlevel<\\/em> - Not so. High and low level are in relation to how far the language is from the \\\"\\\"metal\\\"\\\" of the computer. It expresses its concepts on a different abstraction level.)<\\/p> <p>However: From Python, you can easily call procedures and functions written in C, for instance (and many other languages). So, if you need to get lowlevel stuff done, you write it in C. Then you want to do advanced operations on the data you send to the lowlevel procedures. Those bits you write in Python.<\\/p> <p><strong>So, what is the answer, then<\\/strong><\\/p> <p>The answer is that the question is broken. Or, rather, the question is the headline is simple to answer: Yes, Python is a lot more than a scripting and prototyping language. The related question \\\"\\\"Would you use Python for a largescale commercial project?\\\"\\\" however, is wrong. The proper question would be \\\"\\\"Where, in a large-scale, complex commercial project would you be able to use python?\\\"\\\" And there, the answer would be \\\"\\\"In the high-level parts of it, where we need to do complex manipulations on intricate data structures, or use flexible generic procedures on varying data sets.\\\"\\\" Would you write an OS in Python? No, but I'd write a computer music system, or a big CRPG, or the user interface of a big database application. I'd farm away the low-level audio and graphics stuff (that is, audio buffering, triangle rendering and so on) to a lowlevel language that does that better, though.<\\/p> <p><strong>So, why isn't everyone using Python, then?<\\/strong><\\/p> <p>Well, that one is easy. As Paul Graham points out - If everyone knew what they were doing, everyone would be using LISP :-) But they don't. Large scale projects are handled by politics and management, and management reads stuff they understand, where words like \\\"\\\"Market share\\\"\\\" and \\\"\\\"Brand visibility\\\"\\\" is important. From that, they learn that Microsoft is important, that everyone is using Visual Dot Net Letter-of-the-month-#, and so that is what must be used in the project, top to bottom. A few years back, it was Java, and a few years before that, it was C++. A lot of years back, it was COBOL.<\\/p> <p>Would you, or could you, use Python in a big commercial project? Sure you could - As you could with almost any language, as long as it allows you to express the kind of data structures and manipulation that you need. Would you use it as the single language? Depends on the project, of course - The user part of a big database application thing could without problem be only Python. Should I learn only Python and use it for everything? No. If you want to be a proficient programmer, you should at least have a lowlevel language such as C under your belt, too. If you want to work at a specific place, you need to know the language used there - If you're going to do major iOS work, you'll want Objective C. This, however, is no reflection on whether one language or another is more suitable in itself for a particular style or scale of project, but has everything to do with the corporate culture and politics of the place you're going to work at.<\\/p> <p>Are you wasting your time learning Python? No. Every programming language you learns adds concepts and patterns to your repertoire, and allows you new and different ways to think about a problem. When you've learned about Pythons list comprehensions, you'll know about those as an elegant way of solving certain problems. Then, you might get stuck on an only-C project. Still, when you see the problem that you're up against, and realise that you could solve it easily using list comprehensions, then you can quickly code up a simulation of them in C, and use that to solve the problem. <\\/p> <p>Every language gives you tools. Every language allows you to use them with more or less difficulty. Every language is useful.<\\/p> <p>Are you bored yet? :-)<\\/p>\\\"\",\"answer\",\"39250\",\"39250\",\"16\\/03\\/2012 10:45\",\"32\",\"\",\"\\\\N\",\"100212075\",\"04\\/02\\/2013 9:34\",\"52099\",\"\\\\N\",\"\\\\N\",\"0\",\"f \"]\n",

So, I guess I can talk about their strengths and weaknesses!<\\/p> <p>I definitely prefer the udacity course over all the courses at coursera. The obvious reason is that in udacity, you can actually learn step by step and when you get stuck, you know exactly where you are in the material. In coursera and MITx, it's not this way. The videos are much longer in both coursera and MITx.<\\/p> <p>Also, in udacity, you actually feel more engaged in the lectures. It's like having a tutor by your side! You see the instructor's hand as he explains the concepts, and you get to do lots of quizes. You actually retain the material learned at udacity better.<\\/p> <p>Having talked about the good sides of udacity, I'll honestly say that the MITx course is also very good and (In my own opinion) better than udacity in some ways (although, these can easily be fixed).<\\/p> <p>Firstly, MITx's course actually gives you a book which you can read to gain more understanding. Secondly, MITx's course provides a 'playground' where you can play around with concepts. You can actually build circuits and see how they work. Thirdly, MITx's course videos are much sharper than those at both coursera and udacity. Also, I must confess that the formating, color and presentation of the MITx page and course is just great! They really put in lots of hours into making their course. Although I think MITx is great, I still prefer udacity to MITx because udacity is more 'hands on' compared to the other courses. I've had a better experience at udacity because they actually give you the important material and not unnecessary detail (Coursera and MITx are really found of giving such detail). I believe it's easier to follow the udacity course more than the others because it's just awesomely structured!<\\/p> <p>In the future, I see udacity being better than coursera and MITx for one reason - they are still under the control of the various institutions, while udacity is free to teach nontraditional courses (like the one about self driving cars! I must confess that that's a brilliant idea for a class.)<br> If those four things I said about MITx previously are implemented in udacity, udacity will definitely be much better than any online education system I know of.<\\/p> <p>If I was to change two things about udacity to make it better, the first will be the formatting (and color) of the  pages and then I will add a 'playground' for practicing at anytime.

      "2014\t[\"50373\",\"PageRank Clarified(?)\",\"cs101 unit6.28 ranking pagerank 6.28\",\"100005545\",\"<p>I really have loved this course and think Dave has done a great job teaching it. However, I thought his explanation of PageRank was a little confusing, so I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m going to take a stab at explaining what I believe is going on. Please let me know if I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m missing something.<\\/p> <p>From what I can tell, PageRank is an algorithm for answering the question: \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153What\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s the probability that someone will view a particular webpage?\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d <\\/p> <p>For the sake of concreteness, let\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s suppose that we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re interested in knowing that probability for udacity.com. Well, there are two ways someone might arrive at udacity.com: 1.) from a link on another webpage or 2.) by opening up his\\/her browser and typing in www.udacity.com\\/clicking on a udacity.com bookmark. <\\/p> <p>Let\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s suppose there are N webpages on the Internet. Initially, we know nothing about their relative popularity, so the probability that someone will pick udacity.com upon opening their web browser is just 1\\/N. (Obviously, certain webpages are much more popular than others, so this equally likely assumption isn't realistic. However, before we run PageRank, we don't know which pages are the popular ones, so we have to assume they're all equally popular. As PageRank iterates, it will discover each page's popularity and this initial assumption will have almost no effect.) The other way someone can get to udacity.com is if he\\/she is currently on another page and clicks a link to udacity.com. To get that probability, we have to sum up the probabilities for every possible website the surfer could currently be on:<\\/p> <p>[probability that the person is on espn.com and clicks link to udacity.com] + [probability that the person is on nytimes.com and clicks link to udacity.com] + \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6<\\/p> <p>To make this calculation clearer, let\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s introduce some notation. Let p(i) be the probability that the web surfer is on page i and L(i) be the probability that he clicks on that page\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s link to udacity.com. Then, the probability that the web surfer is on a particular webpage and clicks on that webpage\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s link to udacity.com is p(webpage)*L(webpage). With this notation, the previous expression becomes:<\\/p> <p>p(espn.com)<em>L(espn.com) + p(nytimes.com)<\\/em>L(nytimes.com) + \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6<\\/p> <p>Of course, for most webpages L(webpage) = 0 (for example, espn.com probably won\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t have a link to udacity.com, so L(espn.com) = 0 and the entire first term drops out). As a result, the only terms that remain will be those with a link to udacity.com. Suppose that, of the N pages on the Net, k of them link to udacity.com. If we label those pages 1 to k. The expression simplifies to:<\\/p> <p>p(1)<em>L(1) + p(2)<\\/em>L(2) + \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 + p(k)L(k).<\\/p> <p>Let\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s label this sum I, for indirect. And let\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s label the probability that the web surfer comes to udacity.com directly upon opening his\\/her browser D (we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ve previously seen that D = 1\\/N). If we let d denote the probability that the web surfer is currently on a webpage, then the probability that he has just opened up his browser and isn't currently on a webpage must be (1-d) (since that person is either on a webpage or not and probabilities must sum to 1). Thus, the probability that a random web surfer arrives at udacity.com is:<\\/p> <p>(probability that he opens his browser and comes directly to udacity.com) + (probability that he is on another page and clicks on a link to udacity.com).<\\/p> <p>In math, this is just<\\/p> <p>(1-d)<em>D + d<\\/em>I<\\/p> <p>Plugging in the values for D and I, we get:<\\/p> <p>(1-d)<em>(1\\/N) + d<\\/em>[ p(1)<em>L(1) + p(2)<\\/em>L(2) + \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 + p(k)L(k)]<\\/p> <p>Now, L(i), the probability that someone who is on page i will click the udacity link, is just 1\\/(number of links on page i) \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c we're assuming the web surfer is equally likely to select any link on the page. Also, p(i), the probability that someone is on page i, is just that page\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s popularity -- i.e., it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s PageRank! Substituting, we get Dave\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s formula:<\\/p> <p>(1-d)<em>(1\\/N) + d<\\/em>[ PageRank(1)<em>(1\\/number of links on page 1) + PageRank(2)<\\/em>(1\\/number of links on page 2) + \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 + PageRank(k)*(1\\/number of links on page k)]<\\/p> <p>Well, almost.
